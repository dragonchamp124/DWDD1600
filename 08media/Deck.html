        <h1>Deck building</h1>
            <h2>Step One: Have a Plan</h2>
                <h3>The first step to deckbuilding is always to have a plan.

Odds are you already have a cool idea in mind, but no sense of direction. Deciding on your deck’s strategy will determine what cards you pick, what your land base will look like, and what colors you play.

There are a few other kinds of strategies than the ones I'm going to cover, but they're the main four that you'll see. You may have a mechanic you like, a tribe, or even just a cool card that you think is worth building around when you start your deckbuilding journey.</h3>
         <h2>Step Two: Decide on Your Colors</h2>
         <h3>Now that you have a game plan you can make other key decisions, like what colors will you run? If we go back to the vampire example from before, it’s clear that you'll probably be black and red given that vampires appear most in these two colors.

But, wait, shouldn’t you do this before deciding on a plan? Actually, no. The game plan you choose will likely influence what colors you want to be. The more colors your deck is, the slower it tends to get. So if your plan is to be an aggressive deck then you probably want to restrict the number of colors you use.


When deciding on your colors, consider how your mana will look. This is of particular importance in Standard given that dual lands and mana rocks rotate every year. Aggro decks need to be able to play spells every turn of the game and can’t take turns off to play lands that enter the battlefield tapped. Lands like the Kaladesh fast lands, the Pathways, and the Ravnica shock lands have all helped enable multicolor aggro decks.

In older formats you have access to as many of these lands as you want, along with the fetch lands that dominate Modern and Legacy, but maybe you have your budget to consider. If your budget is a concern then it can definitely be useful to stick to fewer colors so that you don’t need quite so many expensive dual lands to make your deck come together.

        <h2>Step Three: Do Your Research</h2>
         <h3>You know your theme, your game plan, and your colors. You can now start looking into the cards themselves. You’ve probably got a few cards in mind already, but you need to really fill out the rest of your list.


There are a few easy ways to research cards to add to your deck if you don’t know a lot of cards, the first of which is very simple: talk to your friends. Whether you have friends who play Magic with you or just the awesome people down at your local game store, talking to other people about your deck is bound to help you out. The most important part of getting better as a Magic player is talking to other players and learning from their experiences.</h3>
         <h2>Step Four: Deciding Card Quantities</h2>
         <h3>As a quick guide these are good starting points but each deck will play differently.</h3>

             </tr>
         </table>
         <h2>Step Five: The Mana Curve</h2>
         <h3>our mana curve is one of the most important aspects of your deck. If your curve is way off what it should be then your deck will become inconsistent and you'll lose games to bad draws more often.</h3>
